# How tsdk created

At the end of 2019, after studying Golang backend development for a period of time, I questioned the decision to switch from my accustomed JavaScript language to Golang. Instead, I decided to shift my focus to learning Node.js for backend development.

There are several advantages to using Node.js for backend development:

1. Unified JavaScript or TypeScript for both frontend and backend allows for code sharing for common logic.
2. Find a way to generate frontend code for calling the API written on the Node.js side. This is a core feature provided by the current tsdk.

However, there are some drawbacks to using Node.js for backend development, which led me to reconsider:

1. Issues with code stability in multi-person development (solutions: TypeScript for strong typing, unit testing, interface testing).

2. JavaScript itself is relatively flexible, leading to an increase in complexity and messy code over time (addressed by adopting TypeScript).

3. Many Node.js users come from a frontend background and lack experience in server-side development, such as application layering, distributed architecture, massive concurrency, scaling, and the separation of computing and storage.

4. Truly skilled Node.js developers with deep expertise in server-side development are rare. Hiring a Node.js developer with equivalent server-side capabilities is much more challenging than hiring a Java developer. Entrusting large or complex business tasks to non-professionals is a risky proposition.


For points 1 and 2, adhering to TypeScript and ESLint standards resolves these issues. As for points 3 and 4, lack of experience in these areas is a challenge for anyone learning a new language. The key lies in a fundamental understanding, a focus on essentials, and rigorous code and stress testing.

  As I review the code history, there are pauses, refactoring, and updates. The code has also been
  migrated four times[^1]. Yet, it has never been officially released, like a thorn in my throat.
  Despite having excellent tRPC, I've decided to set aside some time to pull out this thorn. Whether
  it succeeds or if anyone uses it is not my immediate concern.
